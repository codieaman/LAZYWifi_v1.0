hello friends, I made this script for my own use but I am sharing it
with you .. I made it because I am very lazy person..when I start wifi
hacking sometime I forget command sometime I forget way of hacking
then I search tutorials in my harddisk which is very irritating...so I
made this script for lazy peoples..... HOPE YOU ALL LIKE IT....
I add more feature in second version of this script ..and I am not
professional developer.......
HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT:
1. copy lazywifi folder in the root directory.
2. make both script in the folder exutable. Chmod +x filename
3. hs is a folder which make automatically when handshake save.
handshake save in this folder. I give you my wifi
(IRIS402_46-91-DB-7A-CC-45_1.cap) handshake that help you to
understand when you first run this script.the password of my
handshake is 11111111.
4. after handshake save use your bruteforce method..
5. happy hacking :)
NOTE:
when u start bruteforce this line come
.cap file name which is in hs folder :
it mean you rightclick on the handshake file which you want to hack
and copy full name like this IRIS402_46-91-DB-7A-CC-45_1.cap and
this also come
bssid to hack :
so bssid is 46:91:DB:7A:CC:45 for my handshake.
And for dictionary attack you have to give full path of wordlist.
Thank you...
Aman Bhandari
happy hacking :)
